### Checker board 
![Checker board](board_state.png)
There is an algorithm which determines what moves are permitted for each checker piece. The user can select any valid piece and move it to any valid square. When a hit is made the opposing piece is eliminated from the game. There is a mode where the user can play against an agent trained using artificial intelligence.  

### How it's made - checker piece 
![Checker Piece](checker.png)
To make a checker piece one must draw a lot of triangles in a shape to resemble a circle. By adjusting the sine and cosine of 2/3rds of the coordinates we can closely resemble a circle with enough triangles. It also wouldn't be possible without the help of radians.  

### How it's made - checker board
![Checker board construction](color_triangles.png)
Everything in OpenGL is just a triangle. All the 3 coordinates for each triangle must be calculated manually. Along with an red, green, blue, alpha value in the range 0-1 for each corresponding (X, Y) coordinate. Then a buffer is binded to OpenGL and a call to the glDrawArrays() function is made. We specify the vertex shader than the OpenGL engine assembles the triangle shape, rasterizes it, fragments it, and blends it.
